## Getting Started

In order to use the application in development mode, you need to install expo.io.
Check [here](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) for detailled instructions.
You also need to have installed [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (version 15) 
and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) on your computer.

After installing Expo GLI on you computer and Expo GO on your smartphone 
(or tablet) you can use the following commands to build and run the application.

```bash
nvm use
yarn
yarn web
```

The application should've launched properly.
